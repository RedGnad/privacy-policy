We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the information you provide to us. This Privacy Policy explains how our app collects, uses, and protects your data.

1. Data Collection and Use
Location:
Our app uses the Niantic Lightship SDK to retrieve the user's location in order to provide geolocation-based features. We would like to clarify that:

Location data is used solely to improve the user experience by providing contextual services.
No location data is stored or retained on our servers or in any database. The information is processed in real time and is not recorded after use.

The app offers the ability to connect to a Web3 wallet in order to interact with blockchain-related features. However:

No transactions are initiated from this connection.
No financial data is stored or transferred. Logging in simply verifies identity and displays wallet public adress, without involving any movement of funds.
